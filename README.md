# 🏥 Medical Inventory Optimization Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing the inventory system for a medical facility (hospital, clinic, or pharmacy) using Python. The goal is to ensure that medical supplies are always available in the right quantity, at the right time, minimizing overstocking, understocking, and wastage.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a data-driven solution that helps in optimizing medical inventory levels by:

- Identifying usage patterns of critical supplies
- Forecasting future demand using historical data
- Highlighting inefficiencies and overstock issues
---

## 📊 Features

- Analysis of current stock levels and historical consumption
- Detection of slow-moving and fast-moving items
- Forecasting demand using time-series or statistical models
- Identification of safety stock levels and reorder points
- Visualization of stock trends, usage patterns, and optimization metrics

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python (core language)
- Pandas (data manipulation)
- NumPy (numerical operations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)
- Scikit-learn or Statsmodels (for forecasting/demand modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook (interactive analysis and development)

---

## 📈 Analysis & Approach

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Categorization of inventory items based on usage
- Forecasting demand using moving averages or regression
- Optimization recommendations using logic-based or algorithmic rules

---

## 💡 Use Cases
- Hospital inventory departments
- Pharmaceutical store management
- Clinic inventory optimization
- Medical warehouse and supply chain management
